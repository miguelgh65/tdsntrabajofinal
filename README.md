Audio Visualization - UPM
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid - Bachelor's in Telecommunications

Description
This repository showcases my work in the "Audio Visualization" course during my Bachelor's in Telecommunications at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. The primary focus of this course was to understand the underlying techniques to visualize audio in real-time and to create responsive, dynamic visual outputs based on various audio inputs.

Highlights
Real-time Audio Visualization: Developed a system to capture and visualize audio signals in real-time. This helps in understanding the intricacies of sound waves and their representation in a visual medium.

Incorporating Filters: Implemented various filters to modify and enhance the audio signals being visualized. This adds an extra layer of depth to the visualization, allowing for unique and varied outputs based on different filter combinations.

Enhanced Voice (EV) Visualization: Special emphasis was laid on the visualization of enhanced voice signals. This module delved deep into the nuances of voice signals and how enhancements can be visualized differently.

Interactive Features: Added the capability to interact with the visualizations live, such as manipulating them with voice commands or changes in ambient noise.
